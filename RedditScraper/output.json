This is my question.\n\nFrom my understanding which may be limited, it would seem that trading Bitcoin futures should have no influence on the price of Bitcoin as the only thing being traded is a contract as to whether the actual price of Bitcoin will be up or down when the contract expires.\n\nHowever, what we saw just recently when CBOE's first Bitcoin futures contract expired on Jan 17th at $10,900 was that the price of Bitcoin crashed and with it all Altcoins.\n\nMy question is how?\n\nWhat if what really happened was that CBOE together will Wall Street heavy weights decided to crash Bitcoin? After all, Bitcoin and crypto is a direct threat to their livelyhood.\n\nBut how could they do this? According to CCN:\n\n>Many institutional investors are wise to use the futures contracts to lower the Bitcoin price to buy in lower by setting the stop-loss triggers at support levels to push down the price further and further to make it look like a crash. This scares novice investors to support the bears and sell to avoid a total loss. By taking this strategy, the Wall Street investors are strategically pushing down the price for in order to re-enter at much lower levels and potentially set Bitcoin up for another rocket rise to unprecedented highs. Then, assumingly, collect profits and repeat the cycle, increasing profits each time Bitcoin rises and falls.\n\nhttps://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-futures-way-control-cryptocurrency-markets/\n\n**Friday, January 26th when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures contracts on Bitcoin are set to expire**\n\nWhat will happen on the 26th? If Wall Street is actively trying to get Bitcoin and Altcoins to crash, they will again short Bitcoin futures. But behind the scenes, they will be buying now, privately as much Bitcoin as possible without causing large spikes in the trade volume.\n\nJust before the the futures contract expires, they will sell everything, and together their selling will cause the same panic and subsequent crash as on the 17th. Their sell orders will drive the price of Bitcoin down, triggering automatic bot sell orders from other traders, which in turn will cause an ever cascading amount of sell orders to trigger......and crash the price.\n\n**And WallStreet wins**\n\nEach and everytime, they can do this, driving down the price of Bitcoin and every other altcoin, until they win, until they kill Bitcoin and the crypto markets.\n\nIt isn't illegal for them to do this as the cryptomarket is unregulated. Their wallStreet buddies can buy and sell futures as much as they want.\n\nWhile we all suffer\n\n\n**The question is HOW DO WE STOP them crashing Bitcoin and every cryptocurrency.

They sell physical BTC on the settlement date (let's just consider CBOE) --- driving the price down. And make a profit.\n\n(Increase the numbers... remember most large players sat out the first round of futures to observe.)\n\nPls research why gold futures were introduced... It's all about control.

For every long there is a short. For every winner, there\u2019s a loser. Every dollar of one trader\u2019s profit is a dollar lost by another trader.

I agree with you -- most wall street stock people simply are not involved with crypto and did not short en masse....  But a few whales did, hence to 70 million plus short....   Would it NOT behoove them to front load BTC way back in late October and early November when the futures were being announced.... I mean - if they fully intended to short it, then they would/should front load and then closer to the contract start date start buying up the asks to bring up the price.... at the same time create FOMO by going on CNBC etc and claiming that BTC will be 25,000$ by Christmas....\n\nIT is hard to ignore the fact that from the start of the futures announcements to the actual start date, btc rose dramatically....I do not think that was newbs entering and bringing up the price alone.....

This is my question.\n\nFrom my understanding which may be limited, it would seem that trading Bitcoin futures should have no influence on the price of Bitcoin as the only thing being traded is a contract as to whether the actual price of Bitcoin will be up or down when the contract expires.\n\nHowever, what we saw just recently when CBOE's first Bitcoin futures contract expired on Jan 17th at $10,900 was that the price of Bitcoin crashed and with it all Altcoins.\n\nMy question is how?\n\nWhat if what really happened was that CBOE together will Wall Street heavy weights decided to crash Bitcoin? After all, Bitcoin and crypto is a direct threat to their livelyhood.\n\nBut how could they do this? According to CCN:\n\n>Many institutional investors are wise to use the futures contracts to lower the Bitcoin price to buy in lower by setting the stop-loss triggers at support levels to push down the price further and further to make it look like a crash. This scares novice investors to support the bears and sell to avoid a total loss. By taking this strategy, the Wall Street investors are strategically pushing down the price for in order to re-enter at much lower levels and potentially set Bitcoin up for another rocket rise to unprecedented highs. Then, assumingly, collect profits and repeat the cycle, increasing profits each time Bitcoin rises and falls.\n\nhttps://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-futures-way-control-cryptocurrency-markets/\n\n**Friday, January 26th when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures contracts on Bitcoin are set to expire**\n\nWhat will happen on the 26th? If Wall Street is actively trying to get Bitcoin and Altcoins to crash, they will again short Bitcoin futures. But behind the scenes, they will be buying now, privately as much Bitcoin as possible without causing large spikes in the trade volume.\n\nJust before the the futures contract expires, they will sell everything, and together their selling will cause the same panic and subsequent crash as on the 17th. Their sell orders will drive the price of Bitcoin down, triggering automatic bot sell orders from other traders, which in turn will cause an ever cascading amount of sell orders to trigger......and crash the price.\n\n**And WallStreet wins**\n\nEach and everytime, they can do this, driving down the price of Bitcoin and every other altcoin, until they win, until they kill Bitcoin and the crypto markets.\n\nIt isn't illegal for them to do this as the cryptomarket is unregulated.

BTC futures volumes will increase hugely in 2018 -- at which point the \"low volume\" argument disappears\n\n2) **Futures being a zero sum game** --- agree wrt. futures contracts.. but you have to look at the futures and physical BTC markets together otherwise you miss the main point you are trying to disprove\n\nOne side to a futures contract is normally a market maker. \n\nMarket makers will net long and short positions. This means that even though futures contracts are a zero sum game.. when you combine them with BTC physical it is not..... why <-- look at the scenario below.\n\nFund A --- is long 750 contracts\n\nFund B --- is short 1000 contracts\n\nMktMaker is short 750 contracts and long 1000 contracts.. i.e. net 250 long.\n\nFund A thinks BTC price will go up. They will not buy/sell physical BTC -- as this goes against their belief that BTC price will rise.\n\nMktMaker is net 250 long futures -- so will sell 250 physical BTC to hedge.\n\nFund B is short 1000 contracts.. and wants to drive down the price of BTC.. and they have been accumulating 500 BTC. They sell physical BTC on the settlement date (let's just consider CBOE) --- driving the price down. And make a profit.\n\n(Increase the numbers... remember most large players sat out the first round of futures to observe.)\n\nPls research why gold futures were introduced... It's all about control. The powers that be needed a pull the plug mechanism. Sticking a derivatives mkt on top of Crypto gives them this.\n\n**The paragraph from your post below, whilst true is only half the story!!!**\n\n\"A key point to realize is that futures markets are a zero-sum game. For every long there is a short. For every winner, there\u2019s a loser. Every dollar of one trader\u2019s profit is a dollar lost by another trader. If someone wants to bet big that bitcoin is going down, say, by shorting 1,000 bitcoin contracts, there needs to be one or more traders willing to take the opposite side.\"\n\n**\"However it can also be used by speculators\"**\n\nMakes it sounds like speculators are an afterthought and futures contracts are mainly used by good hearted farmers looking to lock in the price of their corn.  Not true ---  > 95% of futures volume in commodities is by speculators... who do not own the underlying phycisal good.\n\n\"Its highly unlikely that futures actually caused any of the sell off, they actually provide stability by helping with price discovery.\"\n\nThis is not true on providing price stability. A derivative on top of a speculative instrument exacerbates price volatility. \n", "subjectivity": 0.3805059523809525, "type": "comment", "matched": "bitcoin", "time": 1517107230.0, "sentiment": 0.03758486793154761}

It's an abstract concept, it's a promise, a trade-off, something that oils the wheels of commerce.\n\nThe problem with crypto currency right now, is the insane valuation. It's almost impossible to do anything with crypto other than invest in it. \n\nThe entire idea that it could free us from market forces is, right now, a totally moot point, as it is valued in FIAT. Nobody, yet, can find any reason for it to exist other than to be a vehicle of investment in order to make more ... FIAT.\n\nPlease challenge me if you think I am wrong, but from where I'm sitting, that is all crypto has going for it - a way to make more REAL currency, you know, the currency that can buy you a coffee, a guitar, a car or a house.\n\nAnyone who would try to tell me anything different, as of this day, this time, right now, is a liar.

Nothing to sneeze at.\n\nA short contract does not actually NEED a corresponding long contract.   For example:  CBOE would \"borrow\" btc from actual account holders on Gemini --- these are regular peoples accounts who are simply buying bitcoin because they want to own it... Like folk here on this board.  Of course in the event of regular Joe wanting to sell his BTC that has already been lent out for shorts then Gemini needs to \"borrow\" from someone else's account to cover that sale.... and so on and so forth.  This is the reason that in the stock world shorts are often hard to come by.  In the stock world:  if you keep a stop limit order on your holdings then the exchange simply will not lend those out for shorts -- its really only longs that let their stocks be lent out for shorts... without their knowledge of course...\n\nanyway.... I agree with you -- most wall street stock people simply are not involved with crypto and did not short en masse....  But a few whales did, hence to 70 million plus short....   Would it NOT behoove them to front load BTC way back in late October and early November when the futures were being announced.... I mean - if they fully intended to short it, then they would/should front load and then closer to the contract start date start buying up the asks to bring up the price.... at the same time create FOMO by going on CNBC etc and claiming that BTC will be 25,000$ by Christmas....\n\nIT is hard to ignore the fact that from the start of the futures announcements to the actual start date, btc rose dramatically....I do not think that was newbs entering and bringing up the price alone.....  Its also very interesting that the price continued pumping right up until the point where CME contracts started.... and then start stagnating the following 2 weeks until the big drop started around january 7th.\n\nWhy was there not another big drop heading into CME contract end?  Because CME holders of shorts would sell their actual BTC holdings along side CBOE shorts...  \n\nI believe that it was a perfect storm -- Korea FUD + Annual downturn + Shorters selling their front loaded BTC at the bid.....\n\nShould I know invest in a tin-foil hat...?  perhaps.
