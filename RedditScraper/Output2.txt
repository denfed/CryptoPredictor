Starbucks Chairman Howard Shultz said the coffee chain plans to incorporate blockchain technology and digital currencies into its long-term payment technology strategy, and hopes to "expand digital customer relationships."

Shultz does not, however, believe that bitcoin will play a role in this strategy, remarking that he didn't believe the original cryptocurrency would "be a currency today or in the future."

He clarified that **Starbucks is not developing a digital currency** or announcing an investment in blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but would like to use its stature to lend credibility to these technologies.

Starbucks' Howard Schultz: A 'trusted' digital currency is coming, but it won't be bitcoin

**"One or a few legitimate" cryptocurrencies are coming, but bitcoin is not one of them**, according to the Starbucks executive chairman.

Schultz sees potential in blockchain, the online ledger technology underlying digital currencies.

Step one, Starbucks joins the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.

Step two, Starbucks starts accepting Ether directly.

Mark my words!
Ethereum? You don’t say. What a revelation!
What's this Ethereum I keep hearing about? It sounds futuristic and new. I'm new to this and looking for a safe coin to double my money andaybe double it again next week. Would Etherereum be a good choice?
Ethereum? I've never heard of it, is it a new ICO? Boy, I can't wait to throw $15 at the course this article is advertising!!!
Ethereum is great...NEO is better
NAV is interesting as a “jack of all trades” coin. It does a lot of things, but it’ll never be the best at any of them. It’s reasonably fast, it’ll have Dapp capability, and it has some level of privacy. 

Its speed will never match RaiBlocks, its Dapp abilities will never hold a candle to Ethereum, and its privacy will never beat Monero. But there will always be a place for a coin that tries to do all three, and that’s NAV.

Edit: I am not sure why I’m being downvoted for this. I’m not insulting NAV; I’m stating facts about what NAV is. What is incorrect about what I’ve said?
Altcoin = any coin that isn’t Bitcoin.

The most important thing to remember is that bitcoin is a technology, not just a currency. The technology is called “blockchain,” or more specifically “distributed blockchain.” 

The technology itself is truly groundbreaking, all memes aside, and will be around for ages. The catch here is that you don’t know which company / blockchain will be the Facebook / Amazon / Google / Netflix  of blockchain.

I would recommend you research the following cryptos. I’m not recommending them - I’m just giving you a list of different cryptos with different use cases that each work differently. Not all of them are intended to be a currency. Some of them are just an asset that will appreciate. If you do research on each of these you should have a good basic understanding of the many use cases of crypto.

Pure currency coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC)
“Bank” coins: ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM)
Simple contract coins: Ethereum (ETH)
Staking contract coins: Neo (NEO), VeChain (VEN)
DAG coins: RaiBlocks (XRB)
Privacy coins: Monero (XMR)
Tokens (contracts): Request (REQ), Modum (MOD), Enigma (ENG).

Hopefully that helps! PM me if you have questions, I love helping new people out.
