Starbucks CEO says they plan to accept digital currencies, but NOT Bitcoin BTC.
Starbucks Chairman Howard Shultz said the coffee chain plans to incorporate blockchain technology and digital currencies into its long-term payment technology strategy, and hopes to "expand digital customer relationships."

Shultz does not, however, believe that bitcoin will play a role in this strategy, remarking that he didn't believe the original cryptocurrency would "be a currency today or in the future."

He clarified that **Starbucks is not developing a digital currency** or announcing an investment in blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but would like to use its stature to lend credibility to these technologies.

Starbucks' Howard Schultz: A 'trusted' digital currency is coming, but it won't be bitcoin

**"One or a few legitimate" cryptocurrencies are coming, but bitcoin is not one of them**, according to the Starbucks executive chairman.

Schultz sees potential in blockchain, the online ledger technology underlying digital currencies.

STARBUCKS is set to become one of the first major high street shops to accept cryptocurrency after it announced plans to incorporate blockchain as part of its payment strategy, but **in a snub it has ruled out using Bitcoin**.

Because we don't know if it is secure yet. I will get downvoted, I'm ready for it but it's the truth. Bitcoin isn't slow and expensive because the devs like it that way. It is slow and expensive because everything such as speed, privacy, fees etc. That all the altcoins are trying to solve, all have trade offs. Either to scaling (privacy) or security/decentralization when it comes to speed and fees.
I hold XRB myself for the potential but people need to understand that it is still untested and nobody knows if it's as good as it seems.
Found the bitcoin investor. Bitcoin is way too slow and fees are way too high for it to ever be a real currency. It’s going to keep falling in value.
This is good for Bitcoin.
They want to use their trusted Starbucks solution. Bitcoin is Trustless - see? Don't trust, verify.
Bitcoin needs to formally figure out what it really wants to be. Store of wealth? Fine. But make it clear.
This is good for Bitcoin.
Is this Starbucks spreading news to drive down the price of Bitcoin?
Understanding Bitcoin Futures: How they work and why they are NOT going to crash the crypto market
Recently there has been a lot of talk about Bitcoin futures causing downward pressure for prices, especially with expectations of a crash around expiry date. Its clear that not many understand how derivatives work or why the specific structure of the CME/CBOE future contracts makes it so there is a pretty much no chance that there is a collusive scheme by futures traders to crash Bitcoin.

So I wrote up a quick description of how it works, and why there are 3 major reasons that futures are not to blame for Bitcoin's decline in price.

#How futures contracts work
-------------------------------

Futures contracts are an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specific date in the future at a specified price. If you take a long position, you agree to buy an asset in the future at a specific price when the contract expires. When you take a short position, you agree to sell an asset at a set price when the contract expires.

A simple example to illustrate: Think of a shipping company who has a bunch deliveries planned in a year. The price of fuel is $2 per gallon today. They can enter a futures contract on an exchange that will allow them to buy say 10,000 gallons of fuel at $2.5 per gallon. A fuel wholesaler might be willing to take this contract on to lock in the $2.5 price guarantee. If a year from now the price of fuel rises to $4 dollars a gallon, the shipping company will save (4-2.5) x 1000 = $15,000. In this case its a risk management tool, often used in financial markets to hedge against the risk of changing prices. However it can also be used by speculators, simply to profit off expected changes in price and these are generally cash settled.

Bitcoin futures are cash settled, meaning **no bitcoins actually change hands when a contract expires**. The differential between spot prices (ie. current price) and the contract price is settled with cash. Winning traders effectively collect their gains from the losers.

A key point to realize is that **futures markets are a zero-sum game**. For every long there is a short. For every winner, there’s a loser. Every dollar of one trader’s profit is a dollar lost by another trader. If someone wants to bet big that bitcoin is going down, say, by shorting 1,000 bitcoin contracts, there needs to be one or more traders willing to take the opposite side.

Bitcoin futures trade on two exchanges: CME and CBOE.

The CME is the big one and offers contracts with a unit size of 5 BTC per contract. It has a contract limit of 1,000, meaning that no one party can have more than 1,000 contracts.

The CBOE offers contracts with a unit size of 1 BTC per contract. It has a contract limit of 5,000 contracts.


#Why Bitcoin Futures aren't crashing Bitcoin
------------------

**Reason #1: There simply isn't enough open interest position or volume**

You can look at the total open interest and volume for BTC Futures on the CME for January 25th, a day before expiry:

http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_volume_voi.html?marginsTab=SOM

The total volume for January was 769, the total volume for all months up to June 2018 is 1,223 contracts. The "open interest" number is the number of contracts which are still open (ie. haven't settled) and its only 139. If you go back to the beginning of the period just after the prior expire date, there were only 560 open contracts for the January 26th expiration date.

What this means that the total market on CME for shorting futures for the end of January period was only 560 x 5 =  2,800 BTC. 

What if those evil Wall Street suits had the brilliant idea to buy Bitcoin back when it was $8,000 and then now flash sell it to bring the price down to profit off the short side? On January 19 the open interest was 560 contracts and the BTC price was $11,500, lets say the entire open interest is actually one group of people colluding to profit off the short positions. That means there is a total of 2,800 BTC value is contractually at stake, with a total nominal value of $32.2 million. Futures markets have something called "margin requirements", which is the minimum amount you have to pony up as collateral when taking a futures position. For Bitcoin its 43%, which means that they would need to put in $13.8 million of capital to short 2,800 Bitcoin.

According to [Bitcointy](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b), the volume traded in Bitcoin/USD on January 19 was around 134,000, with about 16 million BTC in circulation. This actually drastically underestimates the total volume of BTC traded since it excludes the big Asian markets, but let actually give the scenario this benefit. Lets imagine that someone would need to purchase just half of the daily volume (about 77K BTC) or about 0.5% of the total Bitcoin supply and then dumped it, and lets say this caused a huge $3K drop in Bitcoin price from its $11,500 price level back to about $8,500. They would need to pony up $616 milion to purchase just 77K BTC (0.5% of the supply) at $8,000. Assuming they achieve the $3K drop in price, that would net them a profit of 2800 BTC x $3,000 = $8.4 million from a $11,500 settlement price, or about 1% profit on their BTC purchase investment, less than a guaranteed government bond. All of this is assuming that 0.5% of the outstanding float would be enough to drive the price down $3K, and that they could somehow not experience substantial loses themselves in the dump. Basically it doesn't make any sense, the volume of open interest for futures available is simply too low to make this anything akin to profitable. Even if we assume there was a collusion scheme by everyone participating in the short market.

You can look at the Settlements to see the total open interest for all remaining months:

http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html?marginsTab=SOM

The total open interest for all months up to June on January 25th is only 1,459 contracts. That's means the entire market for shorting Bitcoin up to June is only 7,295 BTC. No matter where you set the entry point, the return simply doesn't justify the risk or initial investment required.

**Reason #2: The margin requirements are too high to offer enough leverage to manipulate the market**

One attraction of trading futures is the ability to use relatively small amounts of money to potentially achieve outsized returns. In a lot of futures market, the margin (the amount of money that your broker requires up-front) can be quite small compared to the ultimate value of the contract. For example looking at [CME Futures market for S&P 500 futures](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500.html), each contract is worth about $143,000 (50 x S&P 500 value) and the margin requirement is only $4,800 (as of writing this) or about 3.3% nominal margin rate. 

Your margin account balance is adjusted at the end of every trading day to account for the winnings or losses of the day, this is called daily settlement. If your account balance falls below the margin minimum of $4.8K you'll need to quickly add money to your account or your position will be summarily closed out by your broker. On the plus side, if you've predicted the S&P's direction correctly your profits will be that same as if you completely owned the underlying stocks in the index. A +1% daily move in the S&P500 would yield $1430 (1% of $143,000) in profit even though you only have $4800 invested - a huge return on. Margin requirements this low are only possible because the volatility of the S&P 500 is pretty low and well understood.

On the other hand Bitcoin futures have massive maintenance margin rates. The CBOE requires 40% of the notional amount for maintenance margin, the CME requires 43%. Your broker will likely require more than that. 

Because of the high margin requirements, Bitcoin futures don't offer much leverage compared to just buying Bitcoins outright. You would need to place a huge amount of capital at risk just to get one Bitcoin contract on CME, the equivalent of 5 x (BTC USD value) x 0.43. If you wanted to short just 5 BTC and the price was 11K, that would require a margin of $23,650 to be maintained.

**Reason #3: The big Wall Street Levered Funds aren't actually that into shorting Bitcoin**

The CBOE is smaller than CME, but one neat thing about it is that it releases statistics on groupings for its futures markets, it gives out information on long vs short positions among Levered Funds, Other Reportable entities and Non-reportable. 

The Levered Funds is what we would call "Wall Street", large hedge funds that invest other people's money. The  "Other Reportable" would be other institutional investors but not necessarily trading with other's people's money, and the "Non Reportable" are small time investors and speculators. Here is the breakdown of Bitcoin Futures open interest contracts by these categories:

**Levered Funds** (Large Wall Street hedge funds)

Long | Short
---|-----
1142 | 518
 
**Other Reportable** (Other trading firms that don't necessarily manage money for outside investors)

Long |Short
---|-----
1243 | 3668

**Non Reportable** (ie. small speculators)

Long | Short
---|-----
2665 | 919

http://www.cftc.gov/dea/futures/financial_lf.htm


As you can see 68% of the Levered Funds actually go long on Bitcoin! 

For "Other Reportable" you do have more short interest, but it only adds up to 3668 contracts and at 1 BTC/contract its only 3668 BTC, against 1243 BTC that are long. Finally the non-Reportable are the small time speculators and they're overwhelmingly long. There are a few other smaller categories that make up the difference, but overall there isn't any wide spread of short vs. longs between the big levered funds and the more retail investors.

#So what did cause Bitcoin's correction around the first expiry date?
--------------------------------

There was a plethora of factors that compounded around that mid-January expiry date: the cyclical selloff period that we usually see combined with FUD headlines coming out quickly regarding regulation out of China, Korea and Europe. Its highly unlikely that futures actually caused any of the sell off, they actually provide stability by helping with price discovery.

If futures do have any downward price pressure on Bitcoin, its largely psychological. Let face it, most Bitcoin investors don't understand anything about finance or derivatives, to them the CME futures are this big scary Wall Street boogeyman that is trying to take Bitcoin down. In essence you got a self fulfilling prophecy, lots of people feared the futures expiration would cause a crash so they panicked and sold, bringing the price down. Its a perfect thing to scapegoat after the huge bubble we saw started to correct. This is what I fear, that a lot of people will now look to anything to point their finger at to blame for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency price declines. Everything will be scapegoated, from the CME futures to "weak hand Asians" to governments to Wall Street. 

As we inevitably revert to the mean, very few will be willing to accept that it was their own unrealistic expectations of returns that are continually parabolic that is the sole reason for the gross mispricing of most cryptocurrencies.

>It doesn't matter if futures are "crashing" bitcoin if everyone thinks futures are crashing bitcoin. 

Pretty much the only reason the futures would have an effect around expiry dates: massive ignorance on the side of most Bitcoin investors. On Twitter I would constantly see people tweet out panic with the assumption that bitcoin is actually being traded by futures markets and that if "shorts win the bet" then somehow the longs will have to sell their bitcoin, when its entirely cash settled and uses a reference rate across various exchanges for CME futures.

Basically people are too lazy to even read the basics of how futures work.
You forgot one crucial fact of the cryptocurrency market - It's currently all speculation. 

This means that market sentiment becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It doesn't matter if Bitcoin futures *actually* drive down the price of Bitcoin. If people *believe* that they will, then they panic sell and the price goes down anyway. 
The speculation argument is becoming less true every day. For those that don't know, speculation is not the same as investment. Investment is putting your money to work making more money, like buying income-producing properties. Speculation is buying something in the hopes that someone else will buy it from you for a higher price in the future, such as trying to buy land where you think the new beachfronts will be after global warming runs it's course. I agree that for many of the coins/tokens on the market, the trading is 100% speculative. But there are a few coins that have a product that isn't about money, their tokens just need a value to foster scarcity. I bought some MANA to actually use and play with in a digital world. I bought some Cryptokitties because I wanted to take part in one of the first "games" on the blockchain. Some tokens are shares in a decentralized organization, so they will pay dividends. And those are just a few examples. Bitcoin (and other pure currency coins) are starting to see less speculation too because people are noticing the long transaction times and huge fees. People are actually wanting to transfer value instead of sitting on it and hoping someone buys it for more in the future. Even if your supporting evidence isn't the strongest, your actual point still remains true though; these markets are driven by hype and emotion.
Thanks for taking the time to explain Bitcoin Futures! I was getting confused with all the FUD about them.
I think it is great that people like you take the time to educate others involved in this crazy opportunity of a lifetime evolving through blockchain technology. 
Unfortunately FUD and FOMO are based on an irrational mind set and are purely emotional  reactions. The vastly mass of novice investors entering this market with dreams and hopes of "mooning" quickly is not psychologically prepared to handle the financial rollercoaster of crypto volatility. 
Thank you though for taking the time to elaborate and explain!
Bit by bit (or better Bitcoin by Bitcoin) we're learning and getting smarter and those who don't will sadly loose their money and drop out.
None of this distracts from the fact that the entire value of Bitcoin is based entirely on 'faith' anyway. 

We hear the word 'gold' bandied about - the 'gold' of cryptocurrency. 

But bitcoin has NO intrinsic physical value, there's nothing physical to back it up, such as shiny lumps of gold.

Gold is useful, it's a metal that has shone for the entire breadth of human history, there's a finite amount of it.

Bitcoin is an abstract valued currency that is scarce simply because of an algorithm.

It has no physical value, but then again, FIAT doesn't either. It's an abstract concept, it's a promise, a trade-off, something that oils the wheels of commerce.

The problem with crypto currency right now, is the insane valuation. It's almost impossible to do anything with crypto other than invest in it. 

The entire idea that it could free us from market forces is, right now, a totally moot point, as it is valued in FIAT. Nobody, yet, can find any reason for it to exist other than to be a vehicle of investment in order to make more ... FIAT.

Please challenge me if you think I am wrong, but from where I'm sitting, that is all crypto has going for it - a way to make more REAL currency, you know, the currency that can buy you a coffee, a guitar, a car or a house.

Anyone who would try to tell me anything different, as of this day, this time, right now, is a liar. 
LedgerX already supports options on Bitcoin proper. It's currently for big boys only, but that might change in time. The order book is extremely thin because, to be honest, no one is really interested. 
One of my favorite concepts to talk about is the peer to peer aspect of crypto currency. Due to decentralized crypto having a primary focus on putting money back into the people's hands I could just find my local crypto dealer and make a transaction that way. Services like LocalBitcoin and Payfair will be an alternate route to make transactions in real life means. Even bank transfers between two clients won't stop a client from making these transactions. Crypto is the future whether the government likes it or not. We're about to see some gold backed crypto popping up reaaallly soon.
Frustrated with Bitcoin?it’s time to to invest in ethereum
Or a slew of other coins that are way better than Bitcoin. 
Coins who compare themselves to Bitcoin are putting the bar seriously low.  
Fellow Swiss people, let's tweet #PayWithCrypto at Migros, Coop, Digitec/Galaxus, etc. to consolidate our reputation as a crypto nation :D I really think that's not too far fetched, considering SBB (federal public transport network) sells Bitcoins at their ticket machines.
In which Canton are you living? 
I saw that Lucerne released a newsletter with some information about how to tax cryptos.

Hear me out for a moment:

**Background:**

I'm a student developer/engineer with an entrepreneurial streak who has been getting into decentralized applications and the underlying networks that allow them to exist in the last year or so. I'm also heavily invested in cryptocurrency, as the more I learn the more I realize that I'm in a unique position in time where I can contribute to making the world a more equitable place, and get rich while doing it. (Also, grad school won't pay for itself)

One of the major topics of conversation that comes up in all my discussions with my friends is that in order for cryptocurrency to *really* take off, as in become an integral part of our society and economy **we need to have a spendable, usable currency.** Bitcoin started out as such a currency - I remember back in my days living in LA, I occasionally mingled with a team of twenty-somethings who were on a mission to get as many local businesses as possible to accept BTC as payment - and they had decent success, though this was back in 2013 so transaction fees/times weren't the issue they are now. (I wonder how they are doing now, considering I know that they each held thousands of BTC as early adopters - but I digress...)

These days, BTC is obviously not a viable payment choice. It's become the "gold standard" of the crypto world. It has the most pairings with other coins/tokens, and the longest blockchain by far. However, with transaction times that average hours and fees that peaked at around $30 for an above-average processing time, **it is clear even now with fees around $10 that BTC will likely never be the spendable currency it set out to become.** (I will not wade into the Lightning Network debate - LN has both pros and cons, and that's not the point of this post)

That being said, there are many options out there for faster transaction times, such as LTC, XRB, QASH, etc. and I will also not wade into the technical debates regarding their usability. **The main concern that I have with these instant, low-cost/feeless currencies is that they are still not currencies.** The purpose of a currency is the transfer of value. The triple mocha skinny latte that costs $35 (or whatever absurd price people pay for coffee these days) is worth that price to many people, and they're willing to spend that money in order to receive their glorious caffeine. **However:** when purchasing coffee with fiat, we are doing so with the unspoken understanding that $1 today = $1 tomorrow, excluding the minute amounts of inflation (or rarely, deflation).

**However, let's talk about deflation.** If we all lived in a world where $1 today could buy me 1 cup of coffee, yet tomorrow it could buy me 5 cups of coffee, the entire economy would be turned upside down, as nobody would spend that money with the anticipation that there is a very good chance that same $1 could be worth more tomorrow. *The truth is, all crypto investors/enthusiasts live in that world right now.* 

**Crypto isn't currency, it's (a type of) stock/asset:** 
As stated above, fiat currency works because it's stable. For the sake of this example, let's assume two things:

* RaiBlocks is the de facto "cryptocurrency," with no transaction fees and instant payments. 
* The rest of the world gets their salaries, pensions, welfare in USD.

We've all seen the posts about more and more outlets accepting XRB as payment, which is great for the project and crypto as a whole. However, XRB started out the day yesterday at around $14 per 1.0 XRB, and as of the time of this post is trading at $18.30. 

Yesterday, I went to a coffeeshop that accepts both USD and XRB as forms of payment. I decided to put my XRB to use, and bought an extremely overpriced cup of coffee for 1.0 XRB, or roughly $14 worth of XRB. Today, that purchase I made increased by over $4, even though the transaction already happened. **That's because if I had paid in USD instead of XRB, I would have $4 more in *total assets* today than had I paid in XRB.**

We must all accept the fact that **we haven't bought whatever crypto we may own because we hope to spend it, but because we hope to sell it at a later date for more fiat**, which is what we use to keep ourselves alive - we pay bills, buy food, and keep a roof over our heads thanks to stable fiat. This makes the term "cryptocurrency" a misnomer, *as it is in fact not a currency.* I don't know about you lot, but even if my local supermarket, landlord, and university all accept payments in XRB, **I still wouldn't pay in XRB, as I fully expect my XRB holdings to be worth more in USD/Euros tomorrow than it is today,** whereas I fully expect the value of my bank accounts in euros/dollars to be worth the same tomorrow as it is today. It's a no-brainer: I'm not spending my cryptocurrency, I'm treating it as a stock in the project. I love seeing projects like XRB, REQ, and OMG take off as they are addressing vital concerns in today's economy and cryptosphere, yet I would never spend them unless I had absolutely no fiat left to spend.

**Conclusion:**

I think that until one of two things happens, we will never see truly widespread adoption of businesses accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment:

* the cryptosphere stabilizes to a point where the value of XRB (or whatever instant, feeless coin exists in the future) doesn't considerably appreciate in value in the short term (<5 years), or
* the majority (>50%) of all financial transactions in any given economy are performed with cryptocurrency. 

Curious to hear the community's thoughts.



**TL:DR - We are being incredibly overzealous with our short-term hopes of cryptocurrency adoption, because the profit of investing long-term in cryptocurrency outweighs the benefits of a decentralized currency. Until a Tether-like "stable" currency appears (hopefully with transparency and frequent audits), it doesn't matter if businesses accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, as it will constitute a very minor proportion of all transactions. Therefore, cryptocurrency is (for the foreseeable future) not a currency, but a weird form of stock or asset that we hold in a specific project.**

Edit: words

So because the supply is deflationary & the price of my asset might rise in the future, I will not pay my rent and live under a bridge & I won't spend to put food on the table? That's why Bitcoin or crypto backed currencies is great: it is sound money (research if you don't know what that is):

You're still going to spend on things you want or need (if you want more money rather than going to the movies then you won't spend to go to the movies so what).
If it's a choice between Fiat and crypto, you'll always use Fiat. This reality stifles crypto usage

I've spent Bitcoin on things I wanted, and it's a massive regret that gets worse year by year
Yes you prefer spending inflationary currencies that you know is never gonna be worth more especially for mundane transactions where you might want more consumer protection like with a credit card. And you prefer storing your wealth in a more secure censorship resistant deflationary asset. I don't see an issue with that.
But if all you have and earn is Bitcoin for example, then you will spend that because you won't have a choice and probably won't regret it because you didn't have a choice.
People were still spending their money when there was the gold standard and still spending gold as well when gold was accepted by merchants. It's a mind set change to go back to using sound money,but it's not shortcoming of Cryptocurrencies, it's shortcoming of consumerism mindset brought by inflationary currencies.
As someone who does not frequent either sub very often, is /r/personalfinance against Bitcoin?
Wish I had seen this a few weeks ago. I only knew about Bitcoin back then, until I saw a comment in r/worldnews of all places about how RaiBlocks is the next Bitcoin. That got my attention and I searched for it here, and saw all the posts agreeing about it being the next big thing and I started FOMOing hard, without knowing the concept of FOMO. Well, FML, I ended up buying my first crypto at an ATH and then the crash happened.

But at least I got introduced to all the wonderful concepts of FOMO, HODL, and more importantly, shilling.
Altcoin = any coin that isn’t Bitcoin.

The most important thing to remember is that bitcoin is a technology, not just a currency. The technology is called “blockchain,” or more specifically “distributed blockchain.” 

The technology itself is truly groundbreaking, all memes aside, and will be around for ages. The catch here is that you don’t know which company / blockchain will be the Facebook / Amazon / Google / Netflix  of blockchain.

I would recommend you research the following cryptos. I’m not recommending them - I’m just giving you a list of different cryptos with different use cases that each work differently. Not all of them are intended to be a currency. Some of them are just an asset that will appreciate. If you do research on each of these you should have a good basic understanding of the many use cases of crypto.

Pure currency coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC)
“Bank” coins: ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM)
Simple contract coins: Ethereum (ETH)
Staking contract coins: Neo (NEO), VeChain (VEN)
DAG coins: RaiBlocks (XRB)
Privacy coins: Monero (XMR)
Tokens (contracts): Request (REQ), Modum (MOD), Enigma (ENG).

Hopefully that helps! PM me if you have questions, I love helping new people out.

Bitcoin to BOUNCE BACK? Cryptocurrency will return STRONGER, expert says
Uhh, I don't believe in crypto market "experts". According to my portfolio, I could be an expert myself. But I know everyone is a genius in a bull market, so whatever I guess. 

Edit: But in all fairness, Bitcoin probably will come back stronger, just like anyone could've guessed. Doesn't take an "expert" to figure this out.

There was a thread about crypto on one of the main subreddits the other day. It was exactly what you expected.

To be fair, some folks were posting good stuff and getting upvoted, but there was a shit ton of misinformation too.

For example, one guy didn’t believe in crypto because he didn’t think it was possible to exchange Bitcoin to dollars... 
You can exchange Bitcoin to dollars?
You speaking on behalf of everyone? The majority of the planet does not know what cryptocurrency is. Some have heard of Bitcoin recently but that is probably the extend of it. A short 60-sec video could be helpful when explaining the coin to a lay person. Increased adoption is good for every coin. No one forced you to come into this thread and post this comment, but you felt compelled to do it anyway...
Knumbnuts all developers control a release of any Cryto, even if it's mined there is a release of code etc.  This is just different because it wasn't mined.  Even Satoshi kept a million Bitcoin to himself.

This is probably the most decentralized coin in that it's not controlled by miners.  Then you.have the completely centralized coins like Stellar and Ripple, yuck!
