Starbucks CEO says they plan to accept digital currencies, but NOT Bitcoin BTC.
Starbucks Chairman Howard Shultz said the coffee chain plans to incorporate blockchain technology and digital currencies into its long-term payment technology strategy, and hopes to "expand digital customer relationships."

Shultz does not, however, believe that bitcoin will play a role in this strategy, remarking that he didn't believe the original cryptocurrency would "be a currency today or in the future."

He clarified that **Starbucks is not developing a digital currency** or announcing an investment in blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but would like to use its stature to lend credibility to these technologies.

Starbucks' Howard Schultz: A 'trusted' digital currency is coming, but it won't be bitcoin

**"One or a few legitimate" cryptocurrencies are coming, but bitcoin is not one of them**, according to the Starbucks executive chairman.

Schultz sees potential in blockchain, the online ledger technology underlying digital currencies.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/starbucks-schultz-a-digital-currency-is-coming-but-wont-be-bitcoin.html

STARBUCKS is set to become one of the first major high street shops to accept cryptocurrency after it announced plans to incorporate blockchain as part of its payment strategy, but **in a snub it has ruled out using Bitcoin**.

pretty much everyone just hoping their coin is the chosen one and "so fast"
Have you heard of our Lord and saviour, raiblocks? 
In all honesty? I'm guessing LTC, ETH, and some small coin the CEO has money in.
I mean, they call the coin NEO for a reason.
> "One or a few legitimate" cryptocurrencies are coming

[Dogecoin confirmed](https://i.imgur.com/Fi18CKT.jpg).
1COFFEE=1DOGE
wow
Dogecoin is a better scaling system than bitcoin because it is a litecoin variant. Also the fact that it is inflationary means its volatility over time should decrease faster than other coins.

Which funnily enough means that Dogecoin is actually a superior payment system to bitcoin.
Hello, I'd like to order some Wow
Such beauty, wow

>NOW INTRODUCING OUR NEW ICO STARBUCKS COIN TO BE A LEGITIMATE CRYPTOCURRENCY POWERHOUSE FOR BUYING STARCUCKS SHIT DRINKS WOOOO BEEECONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEC

You missed an opportunity to call it 'Star-Bucks'. 
Hey hey heyyy
MY WIFE STILL DOESN’T BELIEVE IN ME. WHAT AM I GONNA DO? YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN I STARTED TO PUT 10,000 STARBUCKS ON HER TABLE. THEN SHE’S GONNA SAY WHOOAA! 
HA HA HA! YAH YAH YAH!
WHAT AM I GUNNA DO?!
> NOW INTRODUCING OUR NEW ICO STARBUCKS COIN TO BE A LEGITIMATE CRYPTOCURRENCY POWERHOUSE FOR BUYING STARCUCKS SHIT DRINKS WOOOO BEEECONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEC

lold
No shit. Why would anybody buy a $3 coffee with a $10+ transaction fee and wait god knows how long for the transaction to clear.
XLM CONFIRMED
That being said, I hope the chairman does not understand what ‘trusted’ means.
maybe its more reasonable when lightning arrived and they build channels to starbucks from different wallet apps. but I dunno, excited to see which currencies they'll decide for.
The transaction cost is lower now, and the Lightning network already works. In my expectation, Lightning will still be better for this kind of payments comparing to BCH or LTC.

Anyway, we will see, I am fine with any coin they choose, it's not that BTC specifically needs to be used for this kind of small payments. If BTC will become something like a "digital gold", I will be very fine with that.
What rock have you been living under? Show me your $10 tx transaction 
Guess BTCers will have to stick with only StarBlocks.
Finally a company that gets it. Sometimes I wonder if CEOs are able to do any kind of research.
They aren't. They have people for that, lol
Remember this. Most wealthy business owners have likely heard of successful crypto investments or have some themselves. If Howard Shultz has huge holdings in crypto himself or through a fund, you can bet that he’ll use his influence to grow those investments. That’s why, although they can be annoying, whales are very helpful to the crypto world.
Garlicoin for sure. It is the only trustworthy currencie after all. 
Garlicoin will rule em all  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
I wanted to say the same. Definitively GRLC
I think they should partner with breadcoin. Maybe do a cabbage coin dividend. Bitcorn would be so jellyfish.
Broiler network confirmed.  1,000,000 tx/s
XLM might be a worthy candidate 

transactions processes in 3-5 seconds, fees cost pennies
The fees cost something like 0.00001 penny. May have missed a zero
I was surprised to go this far down before seeing this. It’s use case is designed for this, plus with staller’s efforts in Africa seems like it might be a reasonable crypto if Starbucks wants to help bring the coffee farmers into the digital/crypto space. 
If they use the omisego wallet sdk, people will be able to pay with any cryptocurrency 😎
REQ tho...
If you want a laugh head over to the thread on this at r/bitcoin, the amount of cope and salt is great.
I remember last year when users were sneering at newbies saying that Bitcoin wasn't for "coffee transactions".
Or simply accept all with REQ
OmiseGO (OMG) and Plasma...nuff said
Micro fees, speed, and currency agnostic clearing for ANY crypto, fiat, rewards card, or digital asset.  Everybody can play together on the OMG network. 
It makes the most sense here for them to use the OmiseGo platform.

Accepts ALL kinds of fiat. ✔️

Accepts ANY cryptos. ✔️

Credit/debit card support. ✔️

Loyalty points. ✔️

Scaling for global usage. ✔️

Extremely low fees. ✔️

Instant settlement. ✔️

E-wallet software development kit. ✔️

---

If they use OmiseGo, **everyone wins**. 
Those are promises, but let's see. **Ardor now has a Euro fiat gateway working right now**, no need for Tether. BTC, USD, and others on the way.
The trusted part makes me think its Litecoin. It's stood the test of time for 7 years, is very secure, fast and cheap.
Hate to burst bubbles but if you read the articles, Starbucks has no plans to start accepting or investing in crypto. They just state that Schultz has a positive opinion on cryptocurrency in general, but isn’t a fan of bitcoin, per his comments on Starbucks’ earnings call.  
  
The headline & this post are a little misleading. 
That would be cool. I really like Litecoin. Best experience I've had in terms of speed and fees so far.
TX/s on LTC wouldn't be nearly enough.
30min+ for a few confirmations is fast?  You would wait soo much for a coffee? The are many better options for this...
"Blah blah blah, let me shill you on this coin. They were made for Starbucks". - Comments
well, yeah, we discuss cryptocurrencies here on r/cryptocurrency
So which coins will probably be accepted :
LTC, XRB, XLM? 
XLM fa sho
Step one, Starbucks joins the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.

Step two, Starbucks starts accepting Ether directly.

Mark my words!
This is good news for Bitcoin.
Here's an autohotkey script to save everyone some time, 

    ^j::
       Send, This is good news for Bitcoin.
    Return

Now you can simply press Ctrl-J in the comments field on any news article! 
Plasma + OMG = Caffeine ;)
If they also started to serve good coffee, I might actually consider going there.
Burn. But so true.
It’ll be whichever coin makes the biggest donation to his pocket.
Dash can afford this
XRB: No fees. Instant transactions. No environmentally unfriendly mining.

Why wouldn't XRB be the default choice? It is literally the only coin that was designed for these types of transactions that is ready right now.

(XRB is the symbol for Raiblocks)
Its untested, in its infancy stage, exchanges and consumers have run into huge problems , the wallet has huge issues with syncing and nodes and it has literally no volume atm.
You would be stupid to choose xrb over rock solid choices like litecoin or even stellar who have solid track records. 


and im sure this reasonable sceptical post will get downvoted because people have way too much emotion attached to xrb, go for it. truth > hype any day.
Calm down guys. My portfolio has a lot of xrb but the shilling today is crazy.  
XRB HYYYYYYPE!
You're correct indeed.
It will be LTC. XRB has way to far to go until it's implemented into big chain corporate companys.
Because it is super new and isn't battle tested
It’s all that and there is always some bomber excitement going on!

All that being said, let’s have a little patience. We only tested 300 tx/s. Until there is more stress testing, we are still experimental.

Binance first, volume second and the big merchants gotta wait a bit.
Because we don't know if it is secure yet. I will get downvoted, I'm ready for it but it's the truth. Bitcoin isn't slow and expensive because the devs like it that way. It is slow and expensive because everything such as speed, privacy, fees etc. That all the altcoins are trying to solve, all have trade offs. Either to scaling (privacy) or security/decentralization when it comes to speed and fees.
I hold XRB myself for the potential but people need to understand that it is still untested and nobody knows if it's as good as it seems.
XRB evangelism strike force has apparently arrived. Everyone prep for the messianic reports of rapture occurring because their wallets actually started working a week ago.

Edit: your downvotes mean nothing to me
"Ready right now".

Do you seriously believe that? XRB is not anywhere near being ready, seriously. 
I herd Dumb Starbucks is already accepting bitcoin
Confirmed
Would XRP not be an option as they are currently working on a user use
You are correct sir. You didnt see the suggestion in here because: Ripplers arent in the shilling business, but in the money making business.
look at you lame fan boys getting hype. He clearly said this won't happen for years. A lot of shit is going to change in years. And if bitcoin does happen to be working great in a few years you best believe he will change his mind as a smart business man.  Don't get hype on some news that's not gonna come out for years .... things change in years... crypto can even crash and it won't even happen... the possibilities are endless 

Edit* starbucks will not be the first. You people are so naive and small minded it's hilarious. They said it will take years. Someone else can easily beat them to the cake. 
No dude it's gonna be XRB because it's already been working perfectly since the update last week /s
You are the first person I’ve seen in this thread who actually read the articles.
  
He literally says they have no plans to invest in or accept cryptocurrencies. 
Found the bitcoin investor. Bitcoin is way too slow and fees are way too high for it to ever be a real currency. It’s going to keep falling in value.
I vote for RaiBlocks
Of course you do... Everyone's flavor of the month apparently
Come on LTC!
shitcoin for shitcoffee?
"Introducing starbux (SUX) for starbucks!" (stock price triples...)
Could this be the big announcement for LTC coming soon???
no
Either ltc or xrb.
LUMENS
Star-bucks - Stellar = to the stars
I won't pay 10 bucks just so I could pay another 10 bucks for a coffee
HUGE....

i bet either litecoin and/or ripple.... Too soon for Cardano?
I'm all for crypto adoption, but it's going to take a lot to get me away from credit cards, especially when the business pays the fees. I like my free flights around the world 
What if you got more rewards than with a credit card, and it was with a coin that you could sell for anything?
Somebody make STARBLOCKS
No mention of Litecoin? It honestly seems like the most likely candidate. Especially with the news Charlie has been tweeting.

This subreddit is so full of shills it's ridiculous.
Why Litecoin? Even litecoin isn't fast enough to be used as P2P cash. People want to have the transaction completely verified by the time they've sent the funds. Only coin that can achieve something like that right now is RaiBlocks. 
They just spew whatever coin they're holding at the moment so it goes up, they sell, and then spew bullshit about whatever new coin they bought being "the future" and "the best option for Starbucks!!!" 

Fucking annoying to browse this subreddit for that reason. So obvious too that its painful to think that most people here don't give a damn about the technology and just want money. 

Sign of a bubble.
Gotta be litecoin
OmiseGO will be just perfect for them.
Stellar XLM!!🚀🚀
NO to a coin 80% held by founders!
I think Stellar will be a great candidate for these kind of companies to use. Reliable and proven technology with minimal fees and fast transaction speed. 
First one I thought of. They'd be crazy not to accept Stellar.
Starbucks tracking my wallet is bad hence zcash
Obviously he's talking about only the fastest growing garlic meme based crypto currencies.
Starbuck will adopt NAVcoin, thats for sure, after Apple accept NAV  in the Apple store, NAVCoin will be adopted massively! NAVMoph Soon and Valence
Sounds a lot like xrp
New ICO incoming. BUCKS to the moon!

(Serious investors laugh and don't care.)
RIPPLE BAYBAY
Can't wait to pay my coffee in Doge
Fools. They are obviously about Garlicoin, the objectively best crypocurrency.

My GRLC will finally be able to buy garlic coffee to go with my garlic bread. 
Its Qtum
I'm confused about how businesses accept crypto. I was reading about a Subway that started taking btc in 2014 but it was actually transferring btc from one coinbase account to another. Should companies start accepting cryptos directly or should they go through other services like Subway did? Why would they choose one over another, and what is Starbucks going to do?
ARK 
I doubt they will be accepting tokens right now as the market is too immature and volatile but some blockchains have a good technology (no matter the value/volatility of the token) like Stellar.
Stellar would allow you to pay in any kind of money and Starbuck will still receive $$$
Using such a technology would allow any local to pay with $$/XLM or any tourist to pay with his local currency and Starbucks would still receive $$$. At this point, the XLM will only serve as a bridge currency between the foreign currency and the $ (the main purpose of the Stellar blockchain in fact).

Note : I mentionned Stellar because it's one I know very well but any other blockchain doing the same will be a very good candidate.
why would i use crypto to pay for my coffee when i can use my credit card and get 5% cash back???
Omisego, see McDonalds
It's probably Starbucks rewards lol
ONE WORD LITEPAY!!!! 
That would be LTC as soon as Atomic Swaps are released.
Nothing is happening except vague plans years into the future, so everyone just calm the fuck down. This isn't the news you think it is. This is 
Why does everyone here think it's going to be RaiBlocks?  99% of America has no idea what RaiBlocks is.  If I had never heard of it before, I would have thought it was a knockoff of Legos.
NavCoin with the NavPay app would make the world for Starbucks and thirsty coffe snippers!
i hope they dont make their own ICO with a Statbucks-shitcoin - better they stick to BTC-LN or some other existing low-fee crypto crruency
Uolpvoted to negate your - 1.not sure why the fuck anyone would support yet another personal company coin. I don't want crypto to become a fucking gift card where you gotta track dozens and they are only good at one chain and cannot be redeemed for cash or transferred
Even if Starbucks doesn't, plenty of big companies probably will. And most will probably be awful.
they probably will, shitokens are gonna tank when big brands start their own tokens
Lol, lightning network.... Get your centralised shitcoin out of here.
Makes sense. BTC is propably the least usable. 
ETH, BCH, LTC in the top 10 are all vastly superiour. 
Bch? Lmao
ETH as a currency? 
All these comments speculating which crypto will be accepted.... guys.... have you ever been to Starbucks? They will have their OWN cryptocurrency (and probably blockchain technology as well) They kinda already do with their Star reward program...
The article clearly states that Starbucks is NOT developing its own currency.

> He clarified that **Starbucks is not developing a digital currency** or announcing an investment in blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but would like to use its stature to lend credibility to these technologies.


Ltc would make sense, since the ltc guys are waiting for big news since quite some time, but IMO ltc is too slow to buy coffee with. 

A transfer should not take longer than 5, max. 10 seconds. 

Otherwise they will have to give you the coffee while the transaction is not confirmed yet.

I read somewhere that LN is also instant, but I didn't see that yet.

Whatever it will be, I hope it will work. The worst thing would be if they'd had to disable the payments again after one month cause it caused too much trouble and had too many issues. That would put a bad light on all crypto in the "real world"
There is 0-conf which is reasonable for coffee purchases.
Everyone is confusing transacting and settling.  Visa settles in ~30 days.
Suddenly feeling very good about my investments.

The future looks nice. 
Some weird ass brigading going on here. 
Nothing new really. Especially on a high visibility post like this one with starbucks in the title.
REQ is THE solution
Once they delivered a fully functionnal product, REQ will definitly be big, more and more companies would like to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method, all they need are Request Network to smooth and ease the process.
So bullish on REQ, bags are so heavy though. Main net can't come soon enough. 
They better hurry up or they’re going to get left behind. Other projects are way ahead of them. 
I think Dash has a decent change as being the one. They have a professional team behind them, monthly budget for development, almost instant transactions with InstaSend, low fees and with Evolution coming out it is so easy to use that your grandmother could use it.
But my grandmother is dead
all we need is ltc or vtc
That moment when Btc slowly starts to crumble. 
This looks like a job for XRP. Proven to be working. Everything's in place ready to go. 
So will I have to tax every coffee I purchase?
You already have to pay taxes on any crypto you spend if it causes you to realize a gain, nothing changing here. 
XRB, please!
Oh, no! (Check my username). Well, a crypto that is proven to work would be good. So, Ltc or Dogecoin would be great. Actually, Dogecoin, being inflationary, encourages spending. And they have a very friendly community. And the BEST mascot. 

And I have some, in a wallet, the password of which I CANNOT REMEMBER, dang it! Once in a while I start up the client and plug in my almost correct guesses. Shibes of Dogecoin, HARK! FEAR the day I remember it, for on that day, it SHALL crash, lol!
garlicoin. definitely garlicoin
This is good for Bitcoin.
This is fine. 
A 'trusted' digital currency is coming, but it won't be bitcoin

duh, being trustless is like bitcoin's USP. 

It should be the Unique selling point of all cryptos but unfortunately most cryptos are companies in disguise.
The guys from Dash will be all over this! Thanks for sharing.
The best choices are clearly Dogecoin, Litecoin, Monero, or Zcash
monero?

do you really think a corporate monster like starbucks would endorse a coin providing privacy to individuals?

these crooks hate bitcoin because nobody is in control so they can't coerce a board and CEO into censoring and reversing of tx's.

get a grip on reality these corps are not our friends, they want to financially enslave us and crypto is our last line of defence.
LTC is a great candidat!
LTC can do the job
Right now, what would be the best crypto for buying a cup of coffee? The fastest and with lowest transaction fee?
Xrb is instant and feeless, but doesn’t have the marketing for household name yet.
$Link
Lightning would be good for stuff like this. Could be like a tab that you pay once a month or so. Too bad BTC missed the boat.
For a user experience that is unacceptable. Other than ideological reasons why would this be better than VISA?
Realistically, you would have to transfer crypto into a wallet attached to your Starbucks card. You still pay in usd but refill your card with whatever else 
I mean how could they accept btc? A $5 coffee with a $30 transaction fee
Transactions take too long. 
Well bitcoin is actually shitty for payments so that makes sense.
Sounds like someone who actually knows a thing or two about cryptos
They should accept a few different good cryptos like xrb, ltc, eth, neo, bch, ECA, byteball
Well the true is, Bitcoin its not the only crytocurrency, we have EOS and ETH going pretty good.
Can anyone advice Shultz about LN?
Can Coinbase show some of this good news on their charts
"This is good for bitcoin because _____" - /r/bitcoin, probably.
They want to use their trusted Starbucks solution. Bitcoin is Trustless - see? Don't trust, verify.
Basically everything but bitcoin is better for money transfer, happy to see big corporations get into crypto
It's going to be Dragonchain once it's more mature. Dragonchain is headquartered in Bellevue, WA and is run by ex-Disney executives. They probably already know Howard *I sell shitty coffee to the world* Schultz.
So basically he's talking about Starbucks virtual currency aka Gift cards? Corporations see block chain as helping them secure their own company credit programs, they don't see the value just the utility.
I saw skein
something yesterday that mentioned they were looking at stellar
I can see stellar l, xlm fitting well in it 
Too much SPECULATION. Don't get your dicks hard just quite yet.
I'm not spending my bitcoin on Starbucks are you kidding me it's way to valuable 
IMFCoin is coming. It's only a matter of time. 
GRLC confirmed.
Bitcoin needs to formally figure out what it really wants to be. Store of wealth? Fine. But make it clear.
This is good for Bitcoin.
Honestly, it makes sense. BTC transactions take incredibly long and if someone wanted free starbucks, they just transfer an amount of BTC they don’t have, get their coffee and walk out before SB can do anything about it
Whoa
Good cus by the the time the transaction goes through the coffee will be cold 
Most likely LTC..?
Is this Starbucks spreading news to drive down the price of Bitcoin?
Starblocks

XRB's rebranding revealed!

To the moon!

#fakenews
Stellar would make total sense on multiple levels. Just sayin'
It's ETHOS.
Starbucks... The herald of the flippening
StarbucksBucks
I hour they accept my coin because tech! It would only make did much sense! /s
Wow this is BIG news! Sucks for BTC though. Altcoins will rule!
He is likely is talking about the national crypto currencies, such as the one being developed by the British National Bank.
Gonna go all in on their iced frappachino .... CODL 
Probably ETH or Tron!
Fuck yeah!
Let me guess, they're making a StarBucks crypto!
Am I hearing a SBUX ICO? 
The VP of Payments at Starbucks is an Advisor for r/dragonchain
Eca. Instant transfer with a 5 minute block time, hardly any tx fee. Sounds like it could be useful here.
Why not just accept the low fee and fast currencies. This could possibly go though one of those decentralized exchange cryptos, then everyone wins. 

Many currencies show promise.
When a company like this accepts crypto will their price fluctuate with the value of the currency?   Or will they try to have more stable prices even when the market fluctuates? 
This may be a silly question since, but since I've never seen it done in person I really have no idea.

If they accept crypto X in-store, how do you actually pay it? I mean mechanically. Do I write down their address (which would take forever) and transfer off a mobile wallet? Is there a bluetooth payment system on some app? I've heard of some crypto credit cards but I assume they aren't super common nor take every kind of crypto you'd want to use?

Obviously online payments are simple enough, address to address. Those aren't the ones I'm unsure of.

I'm a cryptoinvestor but I have never seen an in-person retail use of crypto as a currency, so I'm legitimately unsure how this works in real life.
ironically, this is pretty fun:

https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/
This is also great:

https://twitter.com/sakak_musdom/status/956481581245329408
I guess the easiest way would be to scan a qr code generated by the vendor's payment system with your mobile wallet. This should be pretty painless.
I had coffee other day with BizBytes at a coffee shop in FTL

www.bizbytes.net
Get ready for StarBucks on the blockchain
Their rewards card basically is already doing this.  You're giving SBUX USD to load up a card, and you get stars for using it, as well as the opportunity to gain rewards perks (buy a billion lattes in 2 days and get 20 stars!).

Heck, if it could become a digital coin and make a few bucks off of reloading my card in the process... that's a win-win.
It'll be cool if they look at IOTA/XRB to propel it into the forefront of the crypto scene. "no" fees, near instant transactions, it would be perfect for Starbucks.
RaiBlocks, Request or OMG would be absolutely perfect. Ripple could also be used but idk how ideal that would be to use with commerce, would be cool though. Little to no fees.
ripple can censor transactions and since starbucks would not want to be associated with those pesky cryptos that enable donations to wikileaks and other subversive elements ripple and ethereum seem like their coins of choice.
ERC20 token running on top of ETHEREUM seems like it would work.
We all know they are talking about Garlicoin
Starbucks' Howard Schultz: A 'trusted' digital currency is coming, but it won't be bitcoin. "One or a few legitimate" cryptocurrencies are coming, but bitcoin is not one of them, according to the Starbucks executive chairman.
BlockV (VEE) would be a great candidate 
Shit, I wish I could get the inside track on the coin insta 10x upon confirmation.
Starbucks will be accepting Qtum.
Huge if big
VTC pls
Makes sense. They push their order-ahead / pay ahead app pretty hard 
Of course. The fee would be higher the tab...
5 bucks says they're going to make their own coin, which (at best) will be like a gift card. it'll be a promo stunt that'll last a few months and then phase out over 2-3 years.
I’ll take you on that. 
5$ worth of which coin do you want to bet? What are the terms?
I say they adopt use of a currently existing coin and they keep it as long as people actually use it no matter the volatility. 
Duh
Star Bucks (STB) now trading on Coinbase!!
Love the enthusiasm with #paywithcrypto but get your reality hats on - it’s not gonna happen. No one will accept anything so volatile as currency at this stage. One day in the near future, a viable option will arise but it won’t be any of the shitcoin ppl are gambling on today. It will be a bank or government initiative. 
Hi there, would you like a coffee? 
Sure, how much will it cost?
Let me check ...
3.20 'crypto', hold on, it's now 3.40, oh wait, it's 3.60 - tell you what, lets  wait till it hits 3.90 or do you want to gamble on 3.20?
"I'm sorry sir, but all of our coffee is still linked to FIAT, so you may get lucky and your coffee may be cheaper... or more expensive.."
... yeah, right ...
What if we could put the mobile ordering system on the blockchain?
I’ll take a coffee...that’ll be 1 X.

2 years from now...

I’ll take a thousand coffees...that’ll be 1 X.
They’re adopting the tech not the currency
Better be Garlicoin

/r/garlicmarket
Why are all of you snubbing XRP? Did you forget that it's the fastest coin at 2-3 seconds a transaction and costs fractions of a penny?
What if they made their own coin and called it SBUX?
LTC)
Hope his closest friend is Charlie Lee. 
How did they miss their chance to create StarBUCKS??
