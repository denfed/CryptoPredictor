Which coins do you think are undervalued right now by sole virtue of being a pain in the ass to buy?
Basically, I am talking about very solid projects that are not on Binance or other major exchanges. I think that for very small market caps, this doesn't apply as much because you basically have die hard enthusiasts getting the coin however they can. But for more established coins, I think the price is definitely held back by lack of volume. Here are some that I think are hampered by exchanges:

**Raiblocks**: I know, it has been shilled to high heaven, but it has also been incredibly trying to purchase. Bitgrail and Mercatox were constantly down, and there were plenty of issues with withdrawals and deposits (to be fair, part of this was cause by a bug in the XRB code that the devs had to troubleshoot). The only exchange that has been fairly seamless is the recent add to Kucoin, and I think the price is still feeling the effects of all this.

**Factom**: A very solid project with strong partnerships and use cases, but tepid marketing. Because the marketing is lackluster, I think the price is especially affected by only being on a few exchanges like Cryptopia.

**Decision Token (HST)**: Partnered with the United Nations, solid real world use case. Only on a few exchanges like Cryptopia and Kucoin.

**Medibloc**: I am probably going to get shit on for this one because U.S. citizens see too many obstacles to implementation, but it already has partnerships with significant hospitals and clinics in South Korea, and will probably expand to China. It is only on two exchanges, one of which is not in English, and thus most volume right now comes from Korea. The other is a no-name exchange called Gate.io.

**Honorable mentions**: XBY, Sia (not on Binance yet), Golem.

**Reddit Mentions**: Coss, Qash, Payfair, TenX, OriginTrail, WandX, CAN, ACT, INT Chain, MAN, Wagerr

Disclosure: I hold most (but not all) of these coins.


PayFair, OriginTrail and WandX
PayFair
Payfair üëçüèº. I think IDEX and WandX will grow a lot this year and help drive this coin up. 
When is XRB going to Binance? Any news on it?
No one knows except maybe the devs.
Payfair. Only on awful exchanges at the moment but releasing a full working product by the end of February as well as a guaranteed listing on NEXTexchange in 2-3 weeks (no later than February). Hugely undervalued at the moment but community has grown 50x in 2 months and team releases weekly announcements and incredibly active on telegram. Honestly could go 20-30x by EOY with successful platform and adoption. Incredibly excited about this as you could probably tell. 
Hands down RaiBlocks
Coss. 
OriginTrail
Can confirm.. But well worth it
Streamr DATA very undervalued, has partnership with Golem
ACT - Achain. 
ACT is on Kucoin now 
BNTY
I find kucoin pretty easy to use.
INT chain
I will go with Nebulas NAS, which is only available on Huobi and not on big western exchanges like binance bittrex polonium bitfinex etc
QASH by far. Look at their team and what theyre doing. Look at how big they already  are and they arent on the big western exchanges. QASH is the motherload.
Sia for sure.  Solid project, like obviously the future of storage and potentially the backbone of the internet.  Bittrex doesn't alow new users and Binance hasn't accepted them yet.
Factom Popolous and TenX 
PLAY - feel like this might be somewhat of a gamble, implementation of their coin to herosphere.gg supposed to happen within this year, project exists since 2014, market cap 12.5 mil, only trading on coinbene and etherdelta
Shield (xsh) 
TRTL turtlecoin, started from the ground up as a kinda meme coin. It's the next doge
A pain in the ass equates to what? Learning how to manage a eth wallet on IDEX? If so, TRAC/MAN/ARY/EVE. If you are not comfortable with trading on Asian exchanges, then INT/HPB/BTO/NAS
Lol you mention coins on kucoin? What?

Look at HPB. High Performance Blockchain. Only on 1 chinese exchange, Bibox, yet is the Chinese EOS. Going to explode once it gets western recognition
Kucoin is new and has relatively low volume, so yeah, we can't really say that a coin isn't held back by exchanges just because it is on Kucoin (although I do like the exchange).
Eng
MAN - only on etherdelta now. 
HORSE
Wagerr, only on waves exchange!
MAN
MAN, without a doubt

Volume is well over a million even without a proper ED link though, picking up
RChain  The daily volume on this one is ridiculously low for what it is.  I don't think they care though so I am not sure it will get fixed until later this year when they release. Here is a very cursory summary, however I don't agree with the title that it will 100x this year.

CAN
SWFTC

INT
QASH, UFR
ICX
Ada
Garlic - GRLC Hands down the most under valued coin out there!
REQ
It's on Binance. What else do you want?
