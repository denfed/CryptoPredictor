On invitation of the ministry of Economic Affairs and entrepreneur Rutger van Zuidam they shared their experience with this new technology, in which groups of internet users can exchange information by using strict agreements and formulas.\n\nPrince Constantijn kicked of the 'Blockchain Future of Trust' - meeting. From a stage opposite to the throne where his brother, king Willem-Alexander read the king's speech last week.\n\n\"What a bizarre ambiance. To speak in this 800 year old room about this new technology\", the prince said. As ambassador of innovation and entrepreneurship he embraced blockchain technology and calls it an unbelievably important development.    \n  \n> \n**What is blockchain?** \nBlockchain is a chain of internet users who secure and exchange information using agreements and mathematical rules. Outsiders can't tamper with it. Only the ones that it concerns can access and make changes. *(this is factually not correct, but I'm just translating what it says)*\n \n> Those changes are instantaneously implemented across all users. Differences and mistakes are not possible. One central database in a seperate building is replaced by a network of users that can access it by the internet.       \n          \nIt is hard to understand the technology. In that sense blockchain is like radio, television and the internet: everyone uses it, but almost no one can explain how it works.        \n\nBlockchain does not yet exist on a large scale, but the possibilities for the future are limitless, expects co-organizer Van Zuidam.\n\nFor example a secure electronic patient file, a digital passport or a pension fund in where you can manage your own investments. Use cases the government and entrepreneurs are already exploring.\n\nAnother use case is the tax authorities who could grant allowances that strictly can only be used for their intended purposes, for example to pay child daycare or healthcare, and not a new smartphone, for instance.\n\nVan Zuidam: \"Blockchain is also programmable money. You could program virtual money in such a way that it can only be spent on the intended purpose\".\n\n\n> **Where does blockchain come from?** \n\n> Blockchain is a technology that is developed to transact virtual coins like bitcoin. The inventors wanted a system that could operate without banks or supervisors on money trading.\n\nThanks to the build-in reliability and controls by mathematical formulas the process proofs to be useful for much more than the originally intended use case.       \nIf the government and business start to invest tens of millions of euros now, blockchain technology could become an important export product for the Netherlands, Van Zuidam says. \n\nIf it's up to Ren\u00e9 Penning de Vries of the ministry of Economic Affairs it is urgent. He is the proponent of new applications in the National Blockchain Coalition on behalf of the government.\n   \nPenning de Vries: \"We are working on blockchain mortgages. If we succeed, we are the first in the world.\" Mortgage contracts could be so trusted by the technology that, for example, notaries become redundant.        \n\nOther ministries such as Finance, Public Health and Security and Justice are experimenting with applications. This also applies to pension funds, insurers and the Dutch Bank.          \n\n**Blockchain app for the elderly**           \n\nNetherlands Care Institute developed a blockchain app for the elderly in which their caregivers and caregivers can communicate information.       \n          \n\"Colleges and universities must also respond to this development,\" said Penning de Vries. \"We need more people who understand this technology.\"\nPrince Constantijn compares the situation with the early years of the internet, the 90's.

At the invitation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Entrepreneur Rutger van Zuidam, they shared their experiences with this new technology, whereby groups of internet users can exchange information according to strict agreements and formulas.\n\nPrince Constantijn opened the 'Blockchain Future of Trust' meeting. From a stage right opposite the chair where his brother, King Willem-Alexander, presented the throne last week.\n\n\"What a bizarre atmosphere. Talk about this new technology in this 800-year-old space,\" said the prince. He embraced the blockchain technology as ambassador for innovation and entrepreneurship and calls it incredibly important development.\n\n> **What is blockchain?**\n> \n> Blockchain is a chain of internet users who, according to agreements and mathematical rules, capture and exchange information. Outsiders can not attend. Only those involved can make changes and make changes.\n>      \n> These changes will be made immediately to all users. Differences and errors are not possible. A central database in a separate building has been replaced by a network where users can access the internet.\n  \nIt is difficult to understand the technology. In this sense, blockchain seems to be on radio, television and the internet: everyone uses it, but nobody can explain how it works.\n\nBlockchain does not yet exist on a large scale, but future possibilities are endless, expects co-organizer Van Zuidam.\n\nSuch as a safe electronic patient file, a digital passport or a pension that you can invest yourself. Applications that the government and business owners are already working on.\n\nFor example, the Tax Administration can pay out surcharges that can only be spent on care or childcare, and not for example on a new mobile phone.\n\nVan Zuidam: \"Blockchain is also programming money. You can program virtual money so you can spend it alone on the target.\"\n\n> **Where does blockchain come from?**\n> \n> Blockchain is a technology developed to trade virtual coins such as bitcoins. The inventors wanted a system whereby banks and supervisors on the money trade were no longer needed.\n> \n> Due to the built-in reliability and controls via mathematical formulas, the process seems to be interesting for many more processes.\n\nIf government and industry now invest tens of millions of euros, blockchain technology can be a major export product for the Netherlands, says Van Zuidam.\n\nIf it is run by Ren\u00e9 Penning de Vries of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, it is being speeded up. He is the proponent of new applications in the National Blockchain Coalition on behalf of the government.\n\n**Blockchain mortgages**\n\nPenning de Vries: \"We are working on blockchain mortgages. If we succeed, we are the first in the world.\" Mortgage contracts could be so trusted by the technology that, for example, notaries become redundant.\n\nOther ministries such as Finance, Public Health and Security and Justice are experimenting with applications. This also applies to pension funds, insurers and the Dutch Bank.\n\n**Blockchain app for the elderly**\n\nAnd Netherlands Care Institute developed a blockchain app for the elderly in which their caregivers and caregivers can communicate information.\n\n\"HBOs and universities must also respond to this development,\" said Penning de Vries. \"We need more people who understand this technology.\"\n\nPrince Constantijn compares the situation with the early years of the internet, the 90's. With his hypes, bubbles and mistakes. \"But after all, the real jewels remain, the new Google and Amazons.\"", "time": 1506652517.0, "subjectivity": 0.4117134803181315, "platform": "reddit", "matched": "bitcoin"}

Adds Bitcoin and Ethereum to the Goldmoney Holding\nInvestable cryptocurrency holdings will be powered by BlockVault Inc., a new subsidiary that provides institutional-grade custodial and investment services for blockchain assets\n\n TORONTO \u2013 (September 28, 2017) \u2013 Goldmoney Inc. (TSX: XAU) (\u201cGoldmoney\u201d) (the \u201cCompany\u201d), a precious metal financial service and technology company, today unveiled the addition of vaulted Bitcoin and Ethereum as secure and fully-reserved offline investable assets within the Goldmoney\u00ae Holding, a major enhancement that allows qualified clients to buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies with nine global currencies as well as gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion. **With today\u2019s launch, Goldmoney becomes the world\u2019s first publicly traded and regulated financial service to offer insurable, auditable, and Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) compliant exposure to cryptocurrencies.**\n\nFor over 15 years, Goldmoney has been the market leader and original innovator providing direct online access to securely vaulted and insured precious metals. As the market for blockchain assets continues to grow, Goldmoney clients have approached the Company seeking ultra-secure and financially transparent solution for custody of blockchain assets, where an institutional-quality solution still does not exist in the digital asset marketplace. As a result of many months of engineering and product development to meet client demand, the Company is pleased to offer the following services and innovations for eligible Goldmoney Holding owners:\n\nBuying and selling of digital assets that are safely secured in vaulted cold storage. Cryptocurrency offerings currently include Bitcoin and Ethereum; additional leading digital assets will be added over time.\nFunding of Goldmoney Holdings with 50 types of cryptocurrency, enabling wallet holders to sell a variety of cryptocurrencies and fund their Goldmoney Holding with fiat currency to access precious metals and other Goldmoney service offerings.\nWill seek the establishment of peer-to-peer (\u201cP2P\u201d) lending capabilities on digital assets in partnership with Lend and Borrow Trust, allowing owners of Bitcoin and other assets to safely borrow against their positions.\nColdBlocksTM by BlockVault to be launched by year end: Cryptographic innovation for the reification of blockchain cryptocurrencies into institutional-grade investable assets\n\nTrillions of dollars in managed institutional money cannot currently be invested in public blockchain assets such as Bitcoin due to a lack of custodial transparency, institutional-grade insurance, AML standards for chain of integrity, and auditability under IFRS or GAAP accounting standards. Other issues such as counterparty risk in settlement and custody and regulatory compliance also preclude qualified custodians and regulated institutions from participating in the space. ColdBlocks by BlockVault endeavours to solve these industry constraints.\n\nLike London Bullion Market Association (\u201cLBMA\u201d)-approved precious metal bullion, ColdBlocks are prefilled units of cryptocurrency that, through a novel cryptographic method and a physical security aspect, are insurable and auditable as vaulted-custodial assets at any LBMA-eligible vault location around the world that currently secures precious metals. ColdBlocks can be created using any SHA-256 cryptocurrency and have other features that ensure the chain of integrity for the underlying cryptocurrency, knowing precisely where and when each unit was mined and ensuring the cryptocurrency value is never commingled with those belonging to other clients. Through Goldmoney\u2019s experience and expertise in dealing and vaulting precious metals with analogous requirements and standards, the Company\u2019s new BlockVault subsidiary is well positioned to deliver such solutions.\n\nDue in part to the market opportunity, BlockVault will offer ColdBlocks cryptocurrency vaulting and dealing as a B2B API offering. Additionally, a sales team of financial services industry professionals will be hired in the Company\u2019s Toronto office to build the new business line by offering these services to regulated financial service providers, brokerage firms, investment managers, and high-net-worth-individuals.\n\n\u201cWhile institutional markets wait for a bitcoin ETF or other inefficiently-securitized financial structures, we\u2019ve applied our first-principles approach to lowering counterparty risk and increasing accessibility in precious metals to develop a novel solution for secure and insured ownership of blockchain assets,\u201d said Goldmoney CSO Josh Crumb, inventor of the ColdBlocks standard. \u201cWith today\u2019s launch of digital asset dealing and cold storage custody, Goldmoney becomes one of the first publicly traded financial service companies to offer custody services for blockchain assets and one of the only market providers globally with fully transparent and audited Company financials; assurance of one-for-one backing of offline cold storage; and best-in-class regulatory oversight, including know-your-customer (\u201cKYC\u201d) AML policies. With nearly $2 billion in client assets and more than 1 million user signups, Goldmoney has immediately established itself as one of the largest and most well-capitalized providers in the digital asset and cryptocurrency sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the market for Blockchain assets and cryptocurrencies has transitioned from its original premise of powering payments and remittances with a decentralized proof-of-work token to becoming a nascent speculative asset class, it has been perplexing to watch multiple technology companies serve as custodians for these assets \u2013 often safeguarding billions of dollars of wealth \u2013 while providing nearly zero accountability, transparency, or compliance with what are the most basic standards in the financial services industry,\u201d said Goldmoney CEO Roy Sebag. \u201cFor example, not one of the five leading cryptocurrency custodians publishes an annual or quarterly audit, which has undoubtedly prevented most institutional investors from participating in the cryptocurrency space. The idea for ColdBlocks came about when one of our leading institutional investors asked us to devise a way for regulated hedge funds to buy and sell cryptocurrencies while providing the regulatory assurances mandated by their prospectus offering under securities-law. We have invested significantly in R&D over the last few months and used our experience and relationships in cryptography, vaulting of physical assets, insurance, financial regulation, and investment management best practices to develop our first-to-market solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re excited to launch these new services and solve these persistent challenges for our clients, we feel it\u2019s important to remind investors that there are still significant risks when investing in this nascent asset class. Blockchain assets can likely never achieve the store of value, low volatility, and duration risk-free properties of precious metals, as precious metals possess these three related properties physically in nature \u2013 not due to economic theory or network effects in markets. While cryptocurrencies likely possess revolutionary new forms of information utility and transactability, and may be an important asset class for speculation, diversification, hedging the risks and unintended consequences of extreme-centralization in markets, we remain cognizant of the risk that any or all of these assets may ultimately lose all of their value or be deemed illegal by local governments or regulators. It is with this view in mind that we proceed cautiously yet optimistically on behalf of our stakeholders, but continue to value capital preservation over short-term gains when inappropriately risk-adjusted,\u201d added Crumb and Sebag in a joint message to clients and shareholders.          \n\nAbout Goldmoney Inc.\n\nGoldmoney Inc., a financial service company traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:XAU), is a global leader in precious metal investment services and the world\u2019s largest precious metals payment network. Safeguarding nearly $2 billion in assets for clients located in more than 150 countries, Goldmoney is focused on a singular mission to make precious metals-backed savings accessible to all. Powered by Goldmoney\u2019s patented technology, the Goldmoney\u00ae Holding is an online account that enables clients to invest, earn, or spend gold, silver, platinum, palladium and cryptocurrencies that are securely stored in insured vaults in seven countries.

You can't lose money if you think in USD, all you can do is lose potentially more profit than if you'd just stayed in bitcoin.\nBut if you think in satoshi you actually CAN lose money. If the price of bitcoin halves and your altcoin only drops a little, it will appear as being worth more bitcoin but in reality if you sold, you actually lost money.\nEverybody seems to romanticise the idea that this is OK because in the end you just got more bitcoin! But fuck what if it tanks again? All that work and for nothing. Hold some bitcoin, and then make FIAT profit as you day trade.\"----------\n\n\n I partially agree. Trading alts solely to increase satoshi stack could make you lose net USD, but only if you decide to sell during the dip, which is a bad idea unless you're buying in again lower. Trading on this principal carries with it an innate assumption that in the long run, BTC will command a higher price in USD. Yes, If I believe BTC is going to tank relative to USD, I liquidate \"Altcoin A\" into BTC and then liquidate BTC into USD. Waiting for the dip and buying in lower will yield you a larger satoshi stack than you had before. In my eyes, this effectively makes a BTC-USD trade the same as an altcoin trade to make profit in satoshi. You can then re-invest and get the same number of Altcoin A for relatively the same BTC price, unless it's swinging hard, and it is generally still net satoshi profit (unless your margins are crap).  So long as you believe BTC appreciates relative to USD in the long run (2yrs,5yrs,etc.) You will be putting yourself in a better spot.", "time": 1506507141.0, "subjectivity": 0.4664835164835164, "platform": "reddit", "matched": "bitcoin"}

I also have Bittrex for altcoins but it's not nearly as easy to use, so be careful if trying new things.\n\nI would think twice about pulling your IRA, there may become a time very soon where you will be able to use a cryptocurrency ETF for the vehicle in your IRA.  And if it's a Roth IRA you won't have to pay taxes on it when the time comes to pull it out, where as you'll need to pay capital gains on your cryptocurrency.  I have the same amount of money in my Roth IRA as I do in cryptocurrency.  You might think about just taking half of your IRA and putting it into cryptocurrency.  There is a lot of fear right now that the US could do what China is doing and it could have a negative effect on the cryptocurrency market (in the short run), so you might wait awhile for things to settle down.\n\nIf you have already weighed out your options and you are sure about this. \n\nI'm assuming since you are pulling out your IRA you want a long term investment.  Me too.  I have been a speculator in crypto for almost 2 years and have noticed a few trends.  \n\nBitcoin is solid.  If it goes up, all other coins go up.  If it goes down all other coins go down.  It is the least risky cryptocurrency so it may give you the lowest return, but if doubling you money every year is not good enough, buy more riskier alts.  Bitcoin has the largest market share so it is the most stable cryptocurrency investment.  You also need bitcoin right now to buy a lot of other coins on most exchanges, which drives the price up even more.  And Bitcoin is a proof of work coin which means for the past 8 years people have been backing up the network with millions of dollars of electricity bills this means that people have invested actual money into the system.  Ask your friends if they have ever heard of bitcoin, and ask if they have ever heard of cryptocurrency.  Like Comcast, everyone knows what bitcoin is but most couldn't name 2 or 3 other coins.  With bitcoin you can rest at night without checking the price and news a million times,  if you diversify into too many alts you will be on a computer everyday.  Ethereum and litecoin are also pretty stable but they are moody.  All other alts have wild mood swings, but high risk, high reward.\n\nMy portfolio is about \n70% Bitcoin\n8% ethereum\n8% litecoin\n14% altcoins (Neo, Monero, Ark, Bat, Vtc)\n\nDon't take my advice or anyone else's when making a deduction because we are all going to tell you to buy the coins we already have to boost our network.

Every time they integrate a new block of transactions into the blockchain, they receive a \u2018block reward\u2019 and are entitled to print digital currency.\u201d The key point, he says, is that any computer could, in theory, approve transactions, and no single computer could block transactions.\n\nMr. Srinivasan concedes it\u2019s \u201ca big claim\u201d to say the blockchain is the most consequential technology since the internet. \u201cThe internet is programmable information. The blockchain is programmable scarcity.\u201d He elaborates: \u201cAll of these previously disparate things\u2014from physical mail to television to music to movies to telephony\u2014basically got turned into packets of information and got remixed by the internet. Plus things that we normally didn\u2019t even think of as information\u2014your Fitbit , your steps, your Facebook settings\u2014became programmable.\u201d It\u2019s fair to say, he continues, \u201cthat the internet and all things downstream\u2014search engines, social networks, ride sharing, and so on\u2014have basically been the technological story of the last 25 years.\u201d\n\nThe blockchain is the next phase, Mr. Srinivasan says with some zest. \u201cWith the blockchain, everything that was scarce now becomes programmable. That means cash, commodities, currencies, stocks, bonds\u2014everything in finance is going to be transformed, and aspects of finance baked into everything else.\u201d By way of example, Mr. Srinivasan suggests that there could be \u201ca spot market for the cost of storing one megabyte on 1,000 remote computers.\u201d He then offers a slogan for the new age: \u201cIf you deal with information, you need the internet. If you deal with money, you need to deal with blockchains.\u201d Pretty much everyone, he adds, deals with information and money.\n\nThe blockchain, Mr. Srinivasan continues, \u201cis a religion that works.\u201d Here\u2019s why: \u201cIf you take 10,000 people and put them in a circle and they close their eyes hard and say, \u2018Let this plane fly,\u2019 it\u2019s not going to fly. But if they close their eyes hard and say, \u2018Let this thing have value,\u2019 and they all value it, they\u2019ve suddenly got a price for it.\u201d They will exchange things of economic value among themselves, and the external world can interact with them. \u201cIn the same way that once you\u2019ve got enough people, you\u2019ve got a nation, you\u2019ve also got a currency. So, belief is actually something you can now materialize into currency.\u201d\n\nI steer our conversation, here, toward China, where the government has cracked down hard on digital currencies, banning citizens from exchanging them online. Is this the first major blockchain crisis? Mr. Srinivasan ponders the question before noting that \u201cthe Chinese government is actually run by engineers. Hu Jintao was an engineer, as is Xi Jinping. One of the things they do in China is that they actually give seats in government to folks who are successful in technology.\u201d\n\nHe tells me\u2014\u201cnot necessarily in an admiring way\u201d\u2014that there are \u201cprobably not many people in the U.S. government who could explain to you exactly what a \u2018firewall\u2019 is, but that\u2019s a fundamental instrument of policy in China.\u201d Chinese politicians, he says, are more conversant with the long-term implications of information technology than their American counterparts.\n\nBut what does China\u2019s crackdown on bitcoin mean? Mr. Srinivasan believes that Beijing is doing something similar to what it did when it deployed the so-called Great Firewall in the early 2000s. \u201cIt wanted the internet, but it wanted a controlled internet.\u201d It now has a vigorous and competitive Internet economy, with Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, \u201cbut it also takes measures that Western societies would not, in terms of explicit internet censorship.\u201d\n\nIf the Chinese government wants the benefits of the blockchain \u201cwithout the decentralization of bitcoin,\u201d Mr. Srinivasan says, \u201cwe might see a \u2018Great Blockchain of China\u2019\u2014perhaps a \u2018Chinacoin\u2019 issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China.\u201d It may seem too early for \u201csomething of that magnitude\u201d to happen, Mr. Srinivasan says, \u201cbut sometimes the future happens more quickly than we expect.\u201d An interesting question, he adds, \u201cis whether this \u2018Chinacoin\u2019 would just be directly pegged to the renminbi, as seems most likely, or whether it would be freely floating like bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA more plausible short-term alternative, in Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s view, may be that \u201cthe Chinese government asserts its jurisdiction over the Chinese miners who provide most of the world-wide mining capacity of bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d the latter an open-source blockchain-based platform. Mr. Srinivasan imagines a \u201ccat-and-mouse game would likely ensue, after which the Chinese government would gain control of a fork of bitcoin and Ethereum chains, but the rest of the world would fork to different versions of those chains.\u201d The Chinese government could even attempt a hostile takeover of bitcoin.\n\nMr. Srinivasan is confident, however, that the protocols that sustain a decentralized, global digital currency will weather a crisis of this sort. \u201cThis is the kind of test these protocols were built for. If they survive, which I think they will, then we\u2019ve proven something amazing.\u201d We\u2019ll have proven, he says with a smile, \u201cthat there\u2019s now a new kind of digital asset which even a very technically competent and motivated government cannot seize.\u201d\n\n", "time": 1506236381.0, "subjectivity": 0.3678010907849617, "platform": "reddit", "matched": "bitcoin"}

The state is against you.\u201d\n\nThat experience informs his current work. Mr. Srinivasan has called the stateless digital currency bitcoin \u201cthe most important technology of the decade.\u201d I ask him to explain why, and he says, in fact, that he\u2019s amped up the description. \u201cI\u2019d update that today,\u201d he tells me, \u201cto say that the blockchain\u2014which is not just bitcoin\u2014is the most important invention since the internet.\u201d My eyes widen, and he says: \u201cYep. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s consensus among Silicon Valley now, but it\u2019s getting there.\u201d The \u201cblockchain,\u201d he will explain, is like the internet of money\u2014with similar decentralizing and liberating potential.\n\nMr. Srinivasan, who describes his school years as \u201ccompletely wasted,\u201d founded his current company, 21.co, in 2013 with $115 million in seed money from Silicon Valley\u2019s leading venture capitalists. Plainview is now, mercifully, out of sight. \u201cLife in the United States starts with a 13-year mandatory minimum K-12.\u201d Mr. Srinivasan calls it the \u201cschool-ag archipelago,\u201d an awkward pun on the Solzhenitsyn tome about Soviet prison camps. He has a 1-year-old son, whom he will not send to school. Instead he plans to band together with like-minded parents from the tech world and \u201ccrowd-fund a tutor.\u201d\n\nWith his ill-fitting sweatshirt and sweetly inexpert haircut, Mr. Srinivasan doesn\u2019t look much older than a schoolboy. One would be inclined to think of him as a typically arrogant tech-meister were he not so earnest and amiable. In 2006, immediately after earning a doctorate in electrical engineering at Stanford, he co-founded a genetic testing company, which was \u201cconceived in a dorm room.\u201d He was on President Trump\u2019s shortlist to lead the Food and Drug Administration before ruling himself out for the job, and he has courted controversy by calling for Silicon Valley to \u201cexit\u201d from as much government control as possible. He has, in the past, invoked the notion of the \u201cinverse Amish,\u201d a society that \u201clives nearby, peacefully, in the future,\u201d where \u201cwe can experiment with new technologies without causing undue disruption to others.\u201d\n\nSome of Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s views were distorted in news reports, with the now-defunct Gawker describing him as a \u201csecessionist\u201d (and, for good measure, as \u201cbats\u2014 insane\u201d). With evident distaste, he describes the Gawker story as \u201cfake news, avant la lettre,\u201d and notes: \u201cLast I heard, they\u2019d been sued into bankruptcy by profiting from revenge porn. Bitcoin is at $4,000, and Gawker is dead.\u201d\n\nMr. Srinivasan\u2019s present company enables people to be paid in digital currency for replying to emails. It cost me $20 to reach him, payable upon his response, which was almost instant. We met for lunch at his office earlier this week.\n\n\u201cInitially, and in the near future, 21.co is like a better version of LinkedIn InMail,\u201d Mr. Srinivasan says. \u201cSenders attach digital currency to messages to pay people they don\u2019t know to reply.\u201d That\u2019s better than LinkedIn, he suggests, \u201cbecause users are actually paid to reply, senders can mass-message people, and they can send complex surveys to people rather than just simple emails.\u201d The ultimate goal is to facilitate paid work: \u201cAnywhere there\u2019s a phone, there\u2019s a job. You just pick up a phone and whatever your skills, people will send you digital-currency-based jobs. You can click buttons and make money anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask him to explain the \u201cblockchain,\u201d Mr. Srinivasan starts to roll with relish. \u201cShort version? Bitcoin is a way to have programmable scarcity. The blockchain is the data structure that records the transfer of scarce objects.\u201d I ask him to regard me as a dummy, and to give me the longer version.\n\nWe can understand bitcoin and blockchain in four steps, he says. \u201cOne, cash. When A gives a dollar bill to B, he\u2019s transferring a physical object. B has it, and A no longer does. There\u2019s implicit scarcity in the physical world.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-blockchain-is-the-internet-of-money-1506119424", "time": 1506236071.0, "subjectivity": 0.43898778424640494, "platform": "reddit", "matched": "bitcoin"}
